firefox_extentions- 
How it all began: I am trying(2020-06-21) to hide text being typed, in one of the field, on specific website, repeatedly, each time.  


Sources : 
	1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension
	2. https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/
	3. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons

Prerequisites: 
	1. Any text editor.
	2. web-ext node utility. 
	

Steps: follow steps in source #1.


Side note: I am using ubuntu while developing this. 
	Have faced problem(command not found) using web-ext post install globally. 
	So using abloute command path as "/opt/node-v9.7.1-linux-x86/bin/web-ext build" from directory where manifest.json file exists.


To publish use source #3.
